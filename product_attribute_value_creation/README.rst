================================
Product Attribute Value Creation
================================

Avoid creating new attribute values from the product template.


Installation
============

Just install.


Configuration
=============

Product Variants must be activated on Inventory -> Configuration -> Settings.

Go to Inventory -> Configuration -> Attributes and check 'No Create' for those attributes whose values you want to avoid to be created from the product template.


Usage
=====

Go to Inventory -> Inventory Control -> Products. Go into a product and add 'Attributes' and 'Attribute Values' on 'Variants' to create variants. If you try to create a new value, a warning will appear when saving if its attribute is checked as 'No Create'.

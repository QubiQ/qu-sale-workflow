================
Validate Product
================

Demand a validation for every new product.


Installation
============

Just install.


Configuration
=============

The products validation must be set in the company settings.
Validators must be added to the 'Validate products' group.


Usage
=====

The 'Validated' field has been created in the products form and the 'Validate products' menu has been created in Sales -> Catalog.

Every new product is archived and not validated by default. If it stays like that, it can be seen in the 'Validate products' menu under the 'To validate' filter.

If the product is validated, it can be still seen in the 'Validate products' menu, but removing the filter.

If the product is activated, it can be seen in the 'Products' menu, as usually.

You can also validate products massively by selecting them in the tree view and selecting the 'Validate products' action.

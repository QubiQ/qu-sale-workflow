================
Validate Partner
================

Demand a validation for every new partner.


Installation
============

Just install.


Configuration
=============

The partners validation must be set in the company settings.
Validators must be added to the 'Validate partners' group.


Usage
=====

The 'Validated' field has been created in the partners form and the 'Validate partners' menu has been created in Sales -> Orders.

Every new partner is archived and not validated by default. If it stays like that, it can be seen in the 'Validate partners' menu under the 'To validate' filter.

If the partner is validated, it can be still seen in the 'Validate partners' menu, but removing the filter.

If the partner is activated, it can be seen in the 'Customers' menu, as usually.

You can also validate partners massively by selecting them in the tree view and selecting the 'Validate partners' action.

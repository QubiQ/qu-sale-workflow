======================
Compute Product Margin
======================

Compute a product margin depending on a profit percent.


Installation
============

Just install.


Configuration
=============

No special configuration needed.


Usage
=====

Set the "Base Price" and the "Profit Percent" for the product and press "Compute Product Margin". The profit percent will be applied over the base price and the result will be written as the product price.

You can also set the profit percent for the categories and compute the margin for all its products. If the product has a profit percent it will have priority over the category's profit percent.
